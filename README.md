Goal: making 3d shapes from a 2-dimensional enviroment
Project feaures:
- MouseInput
- KeyBoard input
- Javax.Swing:
  - Jframe
  - JPanel:
    - Full screen panel
- Polygons
- Rectangles/ovals
- Repaint
- Timer
- ActionListener

How Do I Run Code?:
- You must download Java and JGrasp to run this code (not explicitly, but if you have anything else, you would know how to run a java file).
- To download Java go to https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp and hit 'DOWNLOAD JAVA'
- To download JGrasp, go to this sketchy-looking website https://spider.eng.auburn.edu/user-cgi/grasp/grasp.pl?;dl=download_jgrasp.html and hit the green 'JGRASP.exe' file nearest to the top of the page. 
- For both Java and JGrasp, procede how the install wizard tells you to.

Version 2:
- For version 2 ONLY use the code within the 'FinalCode' folder. You may have to delete all the code not in that folder for the Final one to run.
- To use version 2, you need the JPanelTest7, Interface4, PolygonObject, and DPoly classes. 
- Open JGrasp.
- In JGrasp, open, save, & compile all files in that order. To compile, hit the green 'plus' in the upper part of the window.
- After compiling, run the JPanelTest7 class by first directly viewing it and then hitting the red 'running man' button directly right to the compile button.
- A fullscreen panel should open, completly white, with wireframe triangle in the left.
- Mouse input should cause circle to move around in the opposite direction of the cursor.
- To view the circle you may have to move the mouse to the upper left hand corner of the screen.
- Keyboard 'w' will grow circle
- Keyboard 's' will shrink circle
- To exit, press 'alt' + 'F4'

Version 1:
- To use version 1, you need the JPanelTest7 & Interface4 classes. 
- In JGrasp, open then save & compile both files.
- After compiling, run the JPanelTest7.
- A fullscreen panel should open, completly white with wireframe triangle
- Mouse input should cause circle to move around in opposite direction
- Keyboard 'w' will grow circle
- Keyboard 's' will shrink circle
- To exit, press 'alt' + 'F4'
